N queen problem is solved by using stacks and backtracking approach. Placing N queens in the NxN chess board without conflicting requires a Stack of N size. Each element in the stack refers to the queen position in a particular column. Evaluation of the given solution is done using problem logic. For partial input and to provide a solution to given inputs, we find the solution close to the userâ€™s solution and show unplaced or correct positions on board. If the position placed is not there in the solution set, then it displays the solution closest to the given input.
